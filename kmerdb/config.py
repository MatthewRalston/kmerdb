The workflow is roughly as follows:

# # # # # # # # # #  #
# profile generation #
# # # # # # # # # #  #
# I have included -p and -b parameters that influence the rate of profile generation.
# The block size (-b) is primarily for the number of .fastq(.gz) records to read at a time.
# The -p parallel feature works within fastq parsing to process k-mer shredding/counting.
#
# -k $K is the parameter that specifies the k-mer resolution
#
# This command used to use PostgreSQL behind the scenes for on-disk k-mer counting
# since memory is limiting for profile generation when dealing 
# with biologically conventional choices of k (20 < k < 35).
#
# Now we're all in memory.
# I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU START WITH MORE MODERATE CHOICES OF K (10 < k < 15)

################################
# The following is some 'basic' guesses about expected memory usage.
# I believe this is an oversimplification of the memory profile for technical language and representation issues.
# The profile loading function reads the array into memory from the file, assuming a certain data encoding.
# The coding is now set to 'uint64' by default, which in theory allows us to only be limited by numpy array size.
# Now that we have that out of the way.
# The integer depth we have is large.
#
#
#
##################
# dimensionality reduction + kmeans
##################
# The first step ('kmerdb matrix') generates one from different profiles with the same choice of k.
# This command uses ecopy to normalize between sample k-mer total counts before PCA/tSNE.
# -n $N is the dimensionality of either PCA or tSNE. A good choice for tSNE is 2.
# If the command is run with PCA without a selected dimensionality, an elbow graph
# will be produced named '{0}'. Please use this graph to select
# the number of principal components to use.
# The pipeline will not continue until -n $N is selected by the user.
# It is not recommended to feed Unnormalized or Normalized matrices directly to 'kmerdb kmeans'
# 
# The PCA/tSNE matrix will be dimReduced ($N) * N, where N is the number of samples/files/profiles.
#
# And finally, a k-means clustering will be done on the reduced dimensionality dataset
# Please note the randomness parameter 'random_state=42' for sklearn's kmeans is fixed at 42.
# Note here that the -k $K is not related to the choice of substring length 'k' for profile generation.
# The 'kmerdb kmeans' command produces two figures, first is an elbow graph looking at up to N clusters.
# This elbow graph will be written to '{1}'.
# The second is the more typical scatterplot of the first two reduced dimensions
# and the k-means clustering labels shown over the scatter.
# This file will be written to '{2}'.

# If you wanted to save a matrix from kmerdb matrix for use on your own
# it is recommended that you consider gzip compressing it if it is the Normalized or Unnormalized matrix
# which we will see is used downstream in the rarefaction and hierarchical analytics pathways.
#

##################
# Hierarchical
##################
#
# The Normalized matrix goes to the distance subcommand, which can use any of scipy's pdist distances
# to form the m x m distance matrix.
# The third step (kmerdb hierarchical)  is to build a dendrogram with scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
# This final step produces a plot in addition to the tsvs produced in the prior steps,
# which can be captured as independent steps or with tee in a pipeline.
